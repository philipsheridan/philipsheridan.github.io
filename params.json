{"name":"Leadership in Action","tagline":"Leadership Patient Perspective","body":"#### NHS Leadership Academy Graduate Scheme - 10/11/2014\r\n#### Theme for the day - The Emotional Labour Of Care\r\n###### A Positive Patient Experience for Graduate Learning\r\n\r\n**Scenario in Context**\r\n\r\nIn 2002 I survived a near fatal motorcycle accident that left me with complex injuries, a below knee amputation and post traumatic stress. \r\n\r\nThe day after I transferred from Intensive Care to the High Dependency Unit the Sister came over to talk with me. She spoke about the consultant who would take the lead on my surgery. She talked not about his expertise as a leading orthopaedic surgion. Instead she told me about other qualities; how he talked with patients, not at them; how he inspired the team without domination; how he recognised expertise in others.  \r\n\r\nIn essence how he connected with people.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to put into words just what a positive impression that made on me. Near death, she offered me a glimmer of hope that kept the spark of life glowing within me.\r\n\r\n**Leadership in action**\r\n\r\nWhen I met my consultant for the first time he introduced himself and his role. He asked about my work and what I liked to do. He shared a little about himself. He offered his best hopes for my recovery while he recognised and affirmed the serious nature of my condition.\r\n\r\nThroughout my care I noticed how he flattened the apparant hierarchary. He did not use his status or role over and above any other member of the team even though he took the lead for my care. His attitudinal behaviour, his words and actions demonstrated that good leadership distributes power. He recognisd my strengths and the strengths of others. He fostered a spirit of ownership toward a common goal, namely the best possible outcome for me.\r\nHe asked for opinions across the team, acknowledged expertise, and expressed his gratitude for everyones participation.\r\n\r\nEveryone, it seemed, worked to an ethos of professional, compassionate care with healthy doses of good humour.\r\n \r\n**Leadership:**\r\n\r\n- Takes on ownership of ones thoughts, words and deeds.\r\n- Seeks partnership and cooperation.\r\n- Engages with the present.\r\n- Fosters dialogue that seeks a common sense of purpose. \r\n- Recognises that context defines ones role.\r\n- Ensures everyone will cross the line together. \r\n- Celebrates the success of everyone.\r\n- Acknowledges expertise in others and defers to them.\r\n- Nutures the growth of others.\r\n- Affirms the good work undertaken by the team day to day.\r\n- Gives credit to others.\r\n\r\n**At the Start of the Day**\r\n\r\n- Make a brew for your colleagues.\r\n- Begin with none work related chit chat.\r\n- Check in with folk, 'How are you?' \r\n- Ease into talk about the work of today.\r\n- What needs picking up from yesterday?\r\n- What must be done?\r\n- What will you do?\r\n- What will you colleagues do?\r\n\r\n**At the End of the day**\r\n- What went well?\r\n- What can we learn from the today?\r\n- What would make a difference? In other words, how do we make life easier for patients and in turn ourselves?\r\n- Tomorrow brings the potential to build on the good work done today. \r\n- Celebrate that.\r\n\r\nGood job, go home. \r\nEnjoy time with your family, friends and colleagues outside of work.\r\nSleep well.\r\n\r\n**First person reflection**\r\n \r\n- How did I contribute to the work of the day?\r\n- What solutions did I offer to meet the tasks of the day?\r\n- How did I support my colleagues?\r\n- When did I roll up my sleeves and lend a hand?\r\n- What would I do differently?\r\n- How will I demonstrate that difference tomorrow?\r\n\r\nGo home, sleep well.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
